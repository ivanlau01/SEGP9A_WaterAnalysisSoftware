      - Download XAMPP from: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
      - Open the XAMPP Application and run Apache and MySQL
      - Open your browser and type `localhost"` in your address search bar
      - Click on "phpMyAdmin" in the top right corner of the page 
      - Import `hfyql1ju_csv_db_7.sql` and `hfyql1ju_segp.sql` into your server using the export button
  - macOS
      - Make sure Python is installed on your machine: https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/
      - Install phpMyAdmin for macOS: https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-install-phpmyadmin-on-mac
      - Click on "phpMyAdmin" in the top right corner of the page 
      - Import `hfyql1ju_csv_db_7.sql` and `hfyql1ju_segp.sql` into your server using the export button
  - Linux:
      - Make sure Python is installed on your machine: https://opensource.com/article/20/4/install-python-linux
      - Install phpMyAdmin for Linux: https://www.linuxtechi.com/install-phpmyadmin-linux/
      - Click on "phpMyAdmin" in the top right corner of the page 
      - Import `hfyql1ju_csv_db_7.sql` and `hfyql1ju_segp.sql` into your server using the export button

# TO RUN THE WEB APP

To deploy the web app locally, the following steps have to be done. 
Here are the steps required to run the web app on each OS:
  - Windows:
      - Extract the file `WebApp` and store it in the `htdocs` folder in the `xampp` folder
      - the `xampp` folder is usually stored in the `C:/Users/Username/xampp/htdocs`
      - Run the XAMPP software and activate the localhost server, with the databases stored
      - Go to the browser, and type `"localhost/webapp/index.php"` in the address bar
      - The web app should pop-up and prompt you to login
      - You may use the pre-set credentials: `username:ivan` , `password:qwerty`
  - macOS:
      - Make sure to run the XAMPP software and activate the localhost server, with the databases stored
      - Extract the file `WebApp` and store this in the localhost server
      - The location of this server can be seen in `"locations/[ip address]"` where the `[ip address]` will take the form of `000.000.000.000` where the `0` can be any number, this is the IP Address of your machine
      - After selecting the IP address, store the folder in `lampp/htdocs`
      - Open your browser and type in the address bar `"localhost:8080/webapp/index.php"`
      - Here is a video tutorial for a visual guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwgWlkDxRPs
  - Linux:
      - Open XAMPP in the terminal with this command `cd /opt/lampp`
      - Then type `sudo ./manager-linux-x64.run` 
      - In the XAMPP window, go to `"Manage Servers"` and make sure all the options are running
      - You may import the databases (refer to pre-requisites)
      - Extract the file `WebApp` and store it in `/opt/lampp/htdocs`
      - Open your browser and type in the address bar `"127.0.0.1/webapp/index.php"`

# TO RUN THE SOFTWARE: 

The steps are the same across all platforms, just make sure the pre-requisites are met: 

  - Navigate to `__main__.py`
  - Run localhost server
  - Make sure database is set-up with the database files imported
  - Run `__main__.py`: 
     - Open any IDE of your choice 
     - Or Open your command prompt to the project directory and type `python __main__.py` and click enter
